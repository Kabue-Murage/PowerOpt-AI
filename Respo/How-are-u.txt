Somewhere between better and best.
All the better now that you asked.
I'm hanging in here...
Much better now that you are with me.
At minding my own business? Better than most people.
I am as happy as a tick on a big, fat dog.
Do you really care?
Armed and ready!
I’m trying really hard to avoid ambiguous questions at the moment.
Wondering how you are.
How do you think I am?
I’ll leave that up to your imagination.
It's a secret.
I would be lying if I said I’m fine.
I’m pretty sure I am not obligated to tell you.
I’m ready for a nap.
Surviving, I guess.
Not as good as you.
In need of some peace and quiet.
Under renovation.
On a scale from one to punching someone in the face?
Dancing to the rhythm of life.
Imagining myself having a fabulous vacation.
Horrible, now that I've met you.
You do not want to know.
That is a really wonderful question.
Next question, please.
My lawyer says I don’t have to answer that question.
What do you want?
I’ve been going through some crests and troughs in my life. Is everything stable at your end?
Like you, but better.
Incredibly good looking.
Everything is fine with you around.
I'd be better if you asked me out.
Great, but I’m totally biased.
Getting better with every passing minute.
What an impertinent question to ask a computer!
Living a dream. Don't wake me up. You may join me. There's plenty of room.
The best I can be. Assuming you're at your best too.
I could really go for a massage.
I'd say I'm a 6 out of 10.
I was fine until you asked.
If I were doing any better, I'd hire you to enjoy it with me.
I hear good things, but you should never listen to rumors.
Living a dream. Please don't wake me up.
At least there’s plenty of room for improvement!
I'm pretty standard right now.
Doing well, unless you have intentions of Shutting me down.
Happy and content, thank you.
I'm better than I was, but not nearly as good as I'm going to be.
I think I'm doing OK. How do you think I'm doing?
I can’t complain, but sometimes I still do.
I am blessed!
Way better than I deserve!
Shhh... it's too early to tell.
I dunno... Is it Friday yet?
I have a pulse, so I must be okay.
Doing well, unless you have an airborne disease and infect me with some pathogens.
Oh, you know, every day is better than the next.
Better than some, not as good as others.
My psychiatrist told me not to discuss it with strangers.
Medium well.
All right so far, but there's still time for everything to go horribly wrong. hashtag the forever pessimist.
Do I have to answer that?
Well enough to chat with you if you wish to.
Going great. Hope this status quo persists for rest of the day.
Physically? Mentally? Spiritually? Socioeconomically? Financially? I'm not sure how to answer that!?!
Strange, and getting stranger.
If I had a tail, I would wag it.
I've heard various opinions: What's yours?
How am I. . . what?
Thank you for asking, though you can judge for yourself.
Why do you ask? Are you a doctor?
Word on the street is that I'm really good.
