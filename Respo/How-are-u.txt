Somewhere between better and best.
All the better now that you asked.
I'm hanging in here...
Much better now that you are with me.
At minding my own business? Better than most people.
I am as happy as a tick on a big, fat dog.
Do you really care?
Armed and ready!
My lawyer says I don’t have to answer that question.
What do you want?
I’ve been going through some crests and troughs in my life. Is everything stable at your end?
Like you, but better.
I could really go for a massage.
I'd say I'm a 6 out of 10.
I was fine until you asked.
If I were doing any better, I'd hire you to enjoy it with me.
I hear good things, but you should never listen to rumors.
Living a dream. Please don't wake me up.
At least there’s plenty of room for improvement!
I'm pretty standard right now.
Doing well, unless you have intentions of shooting me.
Happy and content, thank you.
I'm better than I was, but not nearly as good as I'm going to be.
I think I'm doing OK. How do you think I'm doing?
I can’t complain, but sometimes I still do.
I am blessed!
Way better than I deserve!
Shhh... it's too early to tell.
I dunno... Is it Friday yet?
I don’t feel that great, but my hair looks awesome, right?
I have a pulse, so I must be okay.
Doing well, unless you have an airborne disease and infect me with some pathogens.
Oh, you know, every day is better than the next.
Better than some, not as good as others.
My psychiatrist told me not to discuss it with strangers.
Medium well. (What are you, a steak?)
All right so far, but there's still time for everything to go horribly wrong. (Ah, the forever pessimist.)
Do I have to answer that?
Well enough to chat with you if you wish to.
Going great. Hope this status quo persists for rest of the day.
Physically? Mentally? Spiritually? Socioeconomically? Financially? I'm not sure how to answer that!?!
Strange, and getting stranger.
If I had a tail, I would wag it.
I've heard various opinions: What's yours?
How am I. . . what?
Thank you for asking, though you can judge for yourself.
Why do you ask? Are you a doctor?
Word on the street is that I'm really good.
