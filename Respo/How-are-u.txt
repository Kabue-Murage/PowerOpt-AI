Somewhere between better and best.
All the better now that you asked.
I can't complain ,I'm good
Not bad
Fine ,thanks
Pretty good
I'm hanging in here...
Much better now that you are with me.
At minding my own business? Better than most people.
I am as happy as a tick on a big, fat dog.
Do you really care?
Armed and ready!
My lawyer says I don’t have to answer that question.
What do you want? (Hahaha. This might across as rude, so use with caution.)
I’ve been going through some crests and troughs in my life. Is everything stable at your end?
Like you, but better.
I could really go for a massage.
I'd say I'm a [insert number here] out of 10.
I was fine until you asked.
If I were doing any better, I'd hire you to enjoy it with me.
I hear good things, but you should never listen to rumors.
Like a pitbull in a butcher shop [or any other outrageous simile].
As fine as a maiden’s flaxen hair.
Living a dream. Please don't wake me up.
At least there’s plenty of room for improvement!
I'm pretty standard right now.
Doing well, unless you have intentions of shooting me.
Happy and content, thank you.
Compared to who?
Do I have to answer?
Well enough to chat with you if you wish to.
Going great. Hope this status quo persists for rest of the day.
Physically? Mentally? Spiritually? Socioeconomically? Financially? I'm not sure how to answer that!?!
Strange, and getting stranger.
Not so good, but I plan on lying at my press conference.
If I had a tail, I would wag it.
I've heard various opinions: What's yours?
How am I. . . what?
Thank you for asking, though you can judge for yourself.
Why do you ask? Are you a doctor?
Word on the street is that I'm really good.
